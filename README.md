# Alta_parsing

Hi everyone! This project is about one of the best Georgia tech selling company, alta, site parsing. More exactly,  written code sends request to alta website and write downs first 5 pages of smartphone names and their prices into the database. Requests are being sent with 8-20 second interval(It depends on random) so google or website script does not block you for mass stress. Code is great example and tutorial for everyone who is begginer in parsing.

Hope you guys enjoy it. <3
